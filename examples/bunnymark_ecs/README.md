A popular benchmark made on Donburi.

- Close all other programs for more accurate results.
- Press the left mouse button to add some amount of gophers.
- Adjust the number of gophers that appear at a time with the mouse wheel.
- Increase the number of gophers until the FPS starts dropping below 60 to find out your result.
- To understand that the drop in performance is not a one-off - use the graphs on the left, they show TPS, FPS and the number of objects over a certain time.
- Press the right mouse button to disable batching, this will greatly increase the load, but keep in mind that all measurements were taken without coloring.
